Genetic evolution of a dynamic neural network for pipebots.

List and use of packages:
    pipebot_description: contains robot models
    pipebot_control: robot controller (incl. DNN) and launch file thereof + robot spawner
    pipebot_gazebo: world model and launch file for simple simulation (including controller and robot spawner)
    pipebot_genetic: meta-algorithm (GA) + global launch file
    pipebot_services: config msgs required to interface GA with controller

Build:
    Requires ros-foxy and gazebo >= 11
    in main folder:
    colcon build

Launch:
    For basic simulation:
        ros2 launch pipebot_gazebo pipebot.launch.py 
        (controller is launched too but robot won't move as neural weights are null by default)

    For genetic algorithm:
        ros2 launch pipebot_genetic pipebot_GA.launch.py 
        args:
            gui:=true/false [false]: set to true to see the runs
            run_save:=true/false [false]: set to true to load a previously obtained setting instead of running the optimisation (previous optimisation must have run until completion)
            
        Other parameters (generations, population size, save file) are set in pipebot_genetic/pipebot_genetic/GA_client.py
